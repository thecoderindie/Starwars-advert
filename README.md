I'm working on a fake webinar advert site. The main idea is Luke Skywalker's is lauching a new training academy that isn't focused on the force, but instead focusing on his other passion: Helping others become milk connoiseurs!

**Main Goals**
Create a responisive site for both desktop and mobile.
Create a pleasing design with a StarWars/Space theme.
